# Sensor Networks & Internet of Things practical exercises

Practical exercises of the [Sensor Networks & Internet of Things](http://cds.unibe.ch/teaching/hs15_sn.html) lecture taught at the University of Bern.
These exercises run on the [Contiki](http://contiki-os.org/) embedded operating system.
They were tested on [Tmote Sky](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~konrad/projects/shimmer/references/tmote-sky-datasheet.pdf) nodes.

Most of the exercises can be deployed using the following commands:

```
# make TARGET=sky
# make <name-of-file.c>.upload
# make login
```
